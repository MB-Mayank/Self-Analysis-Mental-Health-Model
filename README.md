# Report on Self-Analysis Mental Health Model Development

## Introduction
Developing a self-analysis mental health model is a challenging task due to the inherent complexity of medical datasets, the need for precise feature extraction, and the importance of model interpretability. This report highlights the difficulties encountered in preprocessing the dataset, the relevance of the dataset compared to others, the hyperparameter tuning pipeline employed, and the extensive research work undertaken to develop a robust model.

## Dataset Complexity and Preprocessing Challenges
The dataset used in this project posed significant challenges due to the following reasons:
- **High Dimensionality**: The dataset contained numerous features requiring careful selection and encoding to improve model performance.
- **Large and High-Quality Data**: The dataset was extensive and well-structured, making it highly suitable for developing an effective model.
- **Categorical and Imbalanced Data**: Many categorical variables needed proper encoding techniques like `TargetEncoder` to retain meaningful information. The imbalance in class distribution necessitated resampling techniques or weighted loss functions.
- **Missing Values**: The dataset had missing values that required imputation methods to ensure data integrity without introducing bias.
- **Feature Scaling and Normalization**: To ensure models like Logistic Regression and SVM performed optimally, preprocessing pipelines were implemented with standardization techniques.

A well-defined preprocessing pipeline was developed using **Sklearn Pipelines**, ensuring efficient transformation, encoding, and scaling of data before model training. The robustness of the dataset allowed for better generalization and improved model performance in real-world scenarios.

## Dataset Relevance Compared to Other Datasets
This dataset was highly relevant for a self-analysis model in the medical field because:
- It captured real-world mental health symptoms, making it applicable to practical use cases.
- Unlike generic classification datasets, it required **context-aware preprocessing**, ensuring models could accurately distinguish between different mental health conditions.
- The dataset was **comprehensive and diverse**, covering multiple aspects of mental health, increasing its applicability.
- Compared to other datasets, it had richer feature representation and real patient insights, making it more applicable for personalized analysis.

## Hyperparameter Tuning Pipeline
To optimize model performance, a **hyperparameter tuning pipeline** was implemented with **Optuna**, involving:
- **Randomized Search and Bayesian Optimization**: To find the best parameters for models like Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression.
- **Cross-Validation**: Using **StratifiedKFold** to ensure robustness across different splits.
- **Automated Feature Selection**: Evaluating feature importance through **SHAP values** and model-specific feature importance metrics.

This approach led to a significant improvement in accuracy and generalizability of the models. The availability of high-quality and large datasets played a crucial role in the effectiveness of hyperparameter tuning.

## Research and Development Efforts
A substantial amount of research work was undertaken, which included:
- **Dataset Exploration**: Understanding the dataset structure, feature relationships, and required transformations.
- **Implementation of Custom Preprocessing Steps**: Developing a robust pipeline for feature encoding, scaling, and handling missing values.
- **Model Selection and Fine-tuning**: Experimenting with multiple models and optimizing hyperparameters for better generalization.
- **Code Understanding and Modification**: Gathering various implementations, analyzing existing approaches, and creating a fully functional model customized for this task.
- **Validation on Large-Scale Data**: Conducting extensive validation using the high-quality dataset ensured better real-world applicability.

## Short Working and Findings
### Working
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Missing values were imputed, categorical features were encoded, and numerical data was standardized.
2. **Feature Engineering**: New relevant features were created and redundant features were removed.
3. **Model Training**: Multiple models were trained, including Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression.
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optuna was used to optimize model parameters, improving performance.
5. **Evaluation**: The best-performing model was selected based on accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC scores.

### Findings
